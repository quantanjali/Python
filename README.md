In financial research, it is the biggest challenge to know the expected price of the stocks to make decisions whether particular share we should buy, hold or sale at a particular time. The objective of this article is to minimise the risk involved in stock trading and maximize the profit by forecasting the stock price and determining its effectiveness. We have used Genetic Algorithm (GA) a tool of Machine learning, to predict the future movement of the stock. Our prediction is based on the work done by Thomas Meyer and Norman Packard (1992) which is popularly known as Meyer Packard Genetic Algorithm on finding "regions of predictability" in time series generated by the Mackeyâˆ’Glass equation. The possibility of utilizing Genetic Algorithm to forecast the momentum of stock price has been previously explored by many optimization models that have subsequently addressed much of the skepticism. We have added this Machine Learning concept of Meyer and Packard to see the trend and forecast the stock price. The experiments were conducted using Python programming and the results reveal that the proposed technique generates a higher accuracy for the prediction.
